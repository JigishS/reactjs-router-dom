# ReactJS Router Dom

React Router DOM enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. This project will helps to understand ReactJs with routing.

**Note:** Here we are using react-router-dom@v5

There are 3 types of routers
1) ```<BrowserRouter>``` Which uses the HTML5 History API. For more information visit 'remotes/origin/browser-router' branch

2) ```<HashRouter>``` Which uses the hash portion of the URL (window.location.hash). For more information visit 'remotes/origin/hash-router' branch

3) ```<MemoryRouter>``` That keeps the history of your “URL” in memory (does not read or write to the address bar). For more information visit 'remotes/origin/memory-router' branch
